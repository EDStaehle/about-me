    <p class="bio">Hello there. My name is Elias Staehle. I am 23 years old. My favorite color is green. I am a United States Marine Corps veteran. During my time in service I was a machinist and a martial arts instructor. I graduated high school and left to the Marine Corps 2 weeks later. I am currently enrolled in Code Fellows to become a software engineer! My favorite thing to do is play video games.</p>
