      <h2>My Professional Achievements, History, and Goals</h2>
      <p>
        As of right now I am attending an immersive coding bootcamp at Code Fellows with the expected finish date of FEB
        23 2023 and obtaining a specialty of a fullstack developer in JavaScript. I would like to to the knowledge and
        experience I gain from this school to obtain jobs in different areas of tech with a primary focus on getting a
        job with a large FAANG-T company such as Facebook. Eventually I would like to use my knowledge and expertise to
        begin a non-profit organiztion to combat the high suicide rate of veterans, active, and reserve members of the
        military.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have served in the United States Marine Corps as a machinist and a martial arts instructor. After I was
        discharged from the military i continued to be a machinist for a short time.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my biggest goals in tech is to learn and understand machine learning to use it to help other people
        affected by natural distasters by using machine learning to learn patterns of these disters and the effects they
        have on the enviroment.
